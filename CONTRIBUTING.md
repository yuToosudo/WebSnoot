WebSnoot: Welcome! We are making parsing tools for doc sanitization! Help us make life easier for all

PDF2XML
A helpful tool to tokenize a pdf and send it to a indexable xml doc

STEAMFITTER
This is a small project that enables a person to set the number of pipes to check for per line in a .tsv file. It will report what lines have too many.

This is helpful for manually trouble shooting auto generated data sets that may have errors preventing a program from intaking it.



If you wish to contribute check out the issues tab

It is in a very early stage so reccommendations are welcome

We are open to Octoberfest this year so feel free to fork and create something unique!
